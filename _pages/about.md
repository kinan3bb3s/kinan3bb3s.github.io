I received my Bachelor's degree in Informatics Engineering, Systems, and Computer Networks from Tishreen University, Syria, in 2015 and my Master's degree from the same department in 2020.

I completed my Ph.D. in September 2024 at the Université du Littoral Côte d'Opale (ULCO), France, with the LISIC Laboratory. My research interests focus on low-rank matrix approximation and completion, inverse problems, and wavelet analysis with applications in hyperspectral imaging.

Before my PhD, I had six years of work experience in software development and business analysis, which helped me to develop my programming, critical thinking, and project management skills on the highest level.
